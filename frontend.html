	<h1>Front-end Challenge</h1>
	<div>
		<h3>Part 1: Map</h3>

		<p>
			Given a set of geographic data about some of our 
			patients, create an HTML page with <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> containing a graph of the U.S. The dataset is 
			available as a CSV file <a href="/states.csv">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The CSV has columns City, State, Zip, Patient ID, and pharmacy. Each row represents a
			single patient. The graph should show show each state in the US, and the color of the 
			state should vary depending on the number of patients in that state (states with more patients, should be darker than states with fewer patients).
		</p>
		<p>
			You may use raw D3 or D3 wrapper libraries.
		</p>
		<p>
			Tip: You will need to aggregate patients from the same state. You can do this 'live'
			on the page, or pre-process the CSV on own before rendering.
		</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Interactions</h3>
		<p>
			Once the graph is rendered, add the following 2 interactions:

			<ol>
				<li>
					When hovering over a state, change the color of the state to black
				</li>
				<li>
					When clicking on a state, show a JavaScript alert with the selected state's 
					name and patient count
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<h3>Rules</h3>
		<p>
			Please use any external libraries or code snippets that you see fit, but please include 
			links / references to whatever you use in your submission. 
		</p>

		<h3>Submission</h3>
		<p>
			When finished, zip up all the files required to load your page, and email them to 
			<a href="mailto:swaraj@semprehealth.com" target="_top">swaraj@semprehealth.com</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Extra credit for:
			<ul>
				<li>Hosting the page at a public URL</li>
				<li>Adding additional, custom interactions and animations</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
